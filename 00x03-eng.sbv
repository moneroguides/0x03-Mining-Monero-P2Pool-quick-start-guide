0:00:05.549,0:00:06.970
Hello and welcome.

0:00:06.970,0:00:12.070
In this tutorial we'll be showing you how
to quickly and easily start mining Monero.

0:00:12.070,0:00:17.020
To do this we'll be downloading and installing
the official Monero wallet GUI.

0:00:17.020,0:00:21.720
This software is built by the community and
distributed by the Monero core team.

0:00:21.720,0:00:26.630
It has a convenient interface which will allow
you to start mining via P2Pool,

0:00:26.630,0:00:31.314
the most effective and simple way to start
earning Monero with your home PC!

0:00:31.955,0:00:36.790
Before getting started there are a couple
of prerequisites: Firstly, as a Windows user

0:00:36.790,0:00:41.300
you will need to have Kleopatra installed
while Linux and Mac users should have gpg

0:00:41.300,0:00:42.300
installed.

0:00:42.300,0:00:47.460
This software is used to verify the contents
of the files and folders we'll be downloading.

0:00:48.230,0:00:53.460
**Mac users beware, this tutorial doesn't
contain specific advice for you.

0:00:53.460,0:00:57.940
However, you should be able to follow the
linux instructions without too much trouble.**

0:00:57.940,0:01:03.000
In addition to this software you'll need 50GB
or more disk space free.

0:01:03.000,0:01:08.159
This is necessary for downloading either a
full of pruned copy of the blockchain.

0:01:08.159,0:01:10.860
This guide assumes no previous mining experience.

0:01:10.860,0:01:15.970
If you already have xmrig and/or the latest
version of the Monero daemon, you may wish

0:01:15.970,0:01:20.310
to to look at the official P2Pool repo
for more specific instructions.

0:01:27.080,0:01:33.060
We're going to start by visiting getmonero.org,
the official website of the Monero Core Team.

0:01:33.060,0:01:37.630
Feel free to browse the site and learn more
about Monero before continuing.

0:01:37.630,0:01:40.740
When you're ready, go ahead and click on the
Downloads tab.

0:01:40.740,0:01:44.500
The software we're interested in is the "Monero
GUI Wallet".

0:01:44.500,0:01:48.970
To download it, scroll down until you reach
the "Downloads" subheading.

0:01:49.259,0:01:55.280
Next, click and download the software which
matches both your hardware and operating system.

0:01:55.280,0:02:00.360
As I'm using Ubuntu, I'll be choosing the
64bit Linux version.

0:02:00.360,0:02:04.890
To check that these are the files intended
for use by the creators weâ€™ll need two important

0:02:04.890,0:02:07.200
pieces of information:

0:02:07.200,0:02:12.000
Either a signed copy of the file hashes;
or a signature file ending with '.asc'

0:02:12.364,0:02:14.699
and the public key of the person who signed
them

0:02:16.400,0:02:21.619
We can find these files using the "Show hashes
to verify your download" drop-down menu.

0:02:22.678,0:02:25.941
The first link gives us a copy of the signed
hashes.

0:02:25.941,0:02:31.370
Simply right click and *save link as* to download
this text file.

0:02:31.370,0:02:35.870
To locate binaryfate's public key, we should
head back to the getmonero site and click

0:02:35.870,0:02:39.010
on the link entitled *in the source code*.

0:02:39.010,0:02:42.750
This link has taken us directly to binaryfate's
public key.

0:02:42.750,0:02:48.360
To download a copy, simply right click on
the *Raw* button and click *save link as*.

0:02:48.360,0:02:55.192
For the rest of the process please take a
look at our guide entitled Importing Public Keys & Verifying Hashes

0:02:56.340,0:03:01.380
Feel free to stop after watching the section
entitled **VERIFYING SIGNATURES & HASHES**,

0:03:01.380,0:03:03.900
as you can then return to this guide.

0:03:03.900,0:03:07.460
Make sure to use the files you have downloaded
now rather than the ones from the other video.

0:03:08.182,0:03:10.800
The process is exactly the same otherwise.

0:03:11.458,0:03:16.030
The following two sections cover installation
for Linux and windows separately.

0:03:16.030,0:03:20.112
Feel free to use the time stamps to get to
the section that suits you best.

0:03:26.770,0:03:31.380
By now you should have downloaded and verified
the contents of your download.

0:03:31.380,0:03:35.900
Now that's done, we're going to start by extracting
the contents of this zipped folder.

0:03:35.900,0:03:40.230
To do this, we need to simply right click
and select *Extract Here*.

0:03:40.230,0:03:45.730
Feel free to place this folder somewhere memorable,
or alongside your other program files.

0:03:45.730,0:03:47.340
Let's take a look through the folders.

0:03:47.340,0:03:52.700
We're looking for the file labelled *monero-wallet-gui.AppImage*.

0:03:52.700,0:03:57.090
Once found, we can start the program by double
clicking.

0:03:57.090,0:04:02.120
We'll first be asked if we want to create
a desktop entry, I'm going to select yes.

0:04:02.120,0:04:06.686
This will provide me with a handy icon to
select each time I want to start mining.

0:04:06.686,0:04:09.230
After that, we are ready to go.

0:04:09.230,0:04:13.492
To continue, please skip over the next section
which is meant for Windows users only.

0:04:20.006,0:04:24.130
By now you should have downloaded and verified
the contents of your download.

0:04:24.130,0:04:28.759
To install the software, simply extract the
contents of the zip file and then double click

0:04:28.759,0:04:30.069
on the installer.

0:04:30.566,0:04:35.229
We'll be prompted to navigate through a welcome
screen and then a licence agreement.

0:04:35.229,0:04:40.129
The Monero Wallet GUI is free and open source
software, so this agreement is shorter than

0:04:40.129,0:04:41.150
you may think.

0:04:42.337,0:04:47.490
After clicking accept and next we will now
need to choose where to install the software.

0:04:47.490,0:04:50.129
I'm going to choose the default location.

0:04:50.514,0:04:54.389
Next, we need to choose the location for our
blockchain data.

0:04:54.389,0:04:58.910
Don't worry about this 90GB requirement, this
has changed and will be covered again in the

0:04:58.910,0:04:59.923
next section.

0:05:01.110,0:05:02.677
Once again we'll select next.

0:05:03.207,0:05:07.139
I want the Monero software to appear in my
start menu, so I'll be leaving this section

0:05:07.139,0:05:09.449
as it is and moving on.

0:05:09.449,0:05:10.930
I don't want a desktop icon...

0:05:10.930,0:05:13.449
I just want to install the software :)

0:05:13.449,0:05:15.000
And there we have it.

0:05:16.235,0:05:19.240
Just a couple of things to do before we continue.

0:05:19.240,0:05:23.509
Let's start by opening the software from the
start menu.

0:05:23.509,0:05:25.629
We are now prompted to set some firewall rules.

0:05:25.629,0:05:30.650
I am going to deselect public networking and
allow private networking.

0:05:30.650,0:05:35.319
In the future, this will allow other computers
in my network to use the blockchain data hosted

0:05:35.319,0:05:36.419
on this computer.

0:05:37.670,0:05:41.540
With that done, it's time to add a rule to
Windows defender.

0:05:41.540,0:05:45.689
Windows may flag the Monero software as a
virus in the upcoming steps, so we'll need

0:05:45.689,0:05:49.370
to create an exclusion rule for the install
folder.

0:05:49.370,0:05:53.289
To do this we'll need to go to the virus and
threat protection settings.

0:05:53.289,0:05:57.460
You can find this by typing it in the search
bar or opening the start menu and typing in

0:05:57.460,0:05:58.720
**virus**.

0:06:00.581,0:06:05.550
Next, under Virus and Threat Protection Settings,
click on Manage Settings.

0:06:05.550,0:06:11.529
Scroll down until you see the *Exclusions*
section and select *Add or remove exclusions*.

0:06:11.529,0:06:16.590
Click *Add an exclusion*, choose folder and
then navigate to the folder that the Monero

0:06:16.590,0:06:19.469
Wallet GUI was installed to.

0:06:19.469,0:06:21.403
Finally, we're ready to continue.

0:06:28.157,0:06:30.779
Welcome to the Monero wallet GUI.

0:06:30.779,0:06:34.409
Feel free to set the language of the interface
before continuing.

0:06:34.409,0:06:37.172
Next we're going to select *Advanced mode*.

0:06:38.263,0:06:40.939
We're going to want to create a brand new
wallet.

0:06:40.939,0:06:45.300
This is because the primary address of your
miner will be visible to the P2Pool network.

0:06:45.300,0:06:49.789
It is good to think of this as a wallet dedicated
to mining only.

0:06:49.789,0:06:54.660
We're then prompted to choose a name for a
wallet, and a save location.

0:06:54.660,0:06:58.703
I'm going to be saving my wallet to an encrypted
drive, which I set up earlier.

0:06:59.730,0:07:04.830
We're also given an opportunity to record
our new seed phrase and the restore height.

0:07:04.830,0:07:09.210
These are important pieces of information
and act as the keys to the wallet.

0:07:09.210,0:07:14.199
After making a copy of this information, select
next and then enter a new, strong password

0:07:14.199,0:07:16.139
to encrypt the wallet file.

0:07:16.139,0:07:21.089
We recommend using password generators usually
bundled with managers such as Bitwarden and

0:07:21.089,0:07:22.590
KeePassXC.

0:07:23.665,0:07:25.968
When you're ready to continue, hit next.

0:07:27.332,0:07:32.400
Mining using this GUI is only possible with
the availability of a local node.

0:07:32.400,0:07:38.800
Hosting a local node is both great for the
security of others and your own personal privacy.

0:07:38.800,0:07:42.629
To run your own local node you need to download
a copy of the blockchain.

0:07:42.629,0:07:47.840
The entire Monero blockchain is currently
around 130GB in size.

0:07:47.840,0:07:51.789
It's constantly increasing in size and is
something you should keep in mind.

0:07:51.789,0:07:55.759
For those who don't have this amount of memory
to spare, you can alternatively download a

0:07:55.759,0:08:01.419
pruned copy of the blockchain, this currently
takes around 50GB of space.

0:08:01.419,0:08:05.479
Depending on your own circumstances you will
want to select different options.

0:08:05.479,0:08:09.779
We're going to download a full copy of the
blockchain to the default location, so all

0:08:09.779,0:08:13.919
that's left to do is click next once again.

0:08:13.919,0:08:18.919
To finish up, all we need to do is review
our settings and select *Create wallet* and

0:08:18.919,0:08:23.569
then enter the password we chose in the previous
step.

0:08:23.569,0:08:27.460
In the bottom left-hand corner of the landing
page you'll notice that the current network

0:08:27.460,0:08:30.409
status is labelled *Synchronising*.

0:08:30.409,0:08:34.029
Be prepared to wait a significant amount of
time for this process to complete.

0:08:34.029,0:08:37.340
It can take anywhere from 12 hours to a week.

0:08:37.340,0:08:41.800
The time it takes to complete will depend
on your blockchain choices, your hardware

0:08:41.800,0:08:44.330
and your internet speed.

0:08:44.330,0:08:49.290
Writing the blockchain to an SSD will guarantee
the best performance.

0:08:49.290,0:08:53.709
Currently weâ€™re only leeching the blockchain
from the P2P network and sharing is caring

0:08:53.709,0:08:57.380
after all, so weâ€™ll want to enable seeding
as well.

0:08:57.380,0:09:02.259
To do this, weâ€™re going to have to set special
rules in the firewall to allow incoming connections

0:09:02.259,0:09:07.600
for the Monero Peer Network (18080) and the
P2Pool Peer Network (37889) on both our computers

0:09:07.600,0:09:08.870
and routers.

0:09:09.432,0:09:14.571
For information on how to do this, you can
check out our  node setup guide which is linked below

0:09:15.630,0:09:19.750
Once your node is synchronised (as you can
see mine is now) it will be time for you to

0:09:19.750,0:09:21.231
move on to the next section.

0:09:27.545,0:09:30.529
Alright, it's nearly time to get our mining
underway.

0:09:30.674,0:09:36.836
Firstly, as a Windows user, you'll want to
close the software and start it again with administrative privileges.

0:09:37.350,0:09:41.630
This can be done by right clicking on the
start menu or desktop icon.

0:09:41.630,0:09:45.020
The software is now synchronised with the
rest of the network and we've now only got

0:09:45.020,0:09:46.882
a few more settings to change.

0:09:47.769,0:09:51.915
We're now to going to select the settings
tab from the menu and then node.

0:09:52.560,0:09:55.877
For now we're going to stop the daemon with
the button provided.

0:09:56.538,0:10:00.000
Next we're going to add the following flags
to the box provided.

0:10:00.829,0:10:03.454
You can find a copy of them in the video description.

0:10:04.051,0:10:08.110
These options help to ensure reliability and
security.

0:10:08.110,0:10:10.951
Once you've entered those settings, you can
restart the daemon.

0:10:12.000,0:10:15.318
To access the mining menu, click on the advanced
tab.

0:10:16.593,0:10:22.279
Here we want to change mode to P2Pool and
confirm we're using the mini side chain, which

0:10:22.279,0:10:24.839
is recommended for all new users.

0:10:24.839,0:10:27.637
We're going to leave everything else as default
for now.

0:10:28.444,0:10:30.416
Let's click Start mining.

0:10:31.464,0:10:37.089
To continue, the Monero software will need
to install the additional P2Pool software.

0:10:37.089,0:10:42.839
It will automatically install it to the same
location and all we have to do is select yes.

0:10:43.920,0:10:48.205
It will take a short while to download and
when it's done, you'll receive a prompt.

0:10:48.770,0:10:51.360
It's finally time to start mining!

0:10:51.360,0:10:54.950
So let's go ahead and select Start mining
once more.

0:10:55.660,0:11:00.980
At first you will see your status change to
Connected + Mining and once everything is

0:11:00.980,0:11:04.749
up and running, the Monero software will then
display your hashrate.

0:11:05.088,0:11:09.000
Your hashrate, is the speed at which your
computer is securing the network,

0:11:09.540,0:11:12.777
the greater your hashrate, the greater your
rewards!

0:11:19.920,0:11:23.932
There are two big incentives for miners to
use the P2Pool.

0:11:23.932,0:11:29.519
First is the low payout threshold and 0% fees
and the other is the ability to sign up to

0:11:29.519,0:11:32.339
the xmrvsbeast raffle.

0:11:32.339,0:11:37.433
If it's your first time hearing about the
xmrvsbeast raffle, here's what you need to know.

0:11:38.360,0:11:44.589
The raffle exists to incentivise miners, especially
those with low powered machines to contribute

0:11:44.589,0:11:46.529
the security of the network.

0:11:46.529,0:11:51.040
You can sign up to the raffle via the xmrvsbeast
website.

0:11:51.040,0:11:54.959
Before heading over there, let's first copy
our new address to the clipboard.

0:11:56.217,0:12:00.069
Registration gives you access to two different
reward streams.

0:12:00.069,0:12:02.459
The first is a sequential boost.

0:12:02.459,0:12:05.589
You can take a look at the boost dashboard
via the link.

0:12:05.589,0:12:09.329
For more details about how it works, just
click on rules.

0:12:10.459,0:12:13.746
Let's head back to the main raffle basboard.

0:12:13.746,0:12:16.681
Once again, for more details, click on rules.

0:12:17.810,0:12:21.519
Now that we've seen how this all works, let's
register.

0:12:21.519,0:12:26.350
To register, you'll need to enter the primary
address of the new wallet you created.

0:12:26.350,0:12:29.310
The token field should be left blank for new
registrations.

As we're new to mining, we'll initially receive
an error message.

0:12:33.600,0:12:37.495
This is because we're yet to prove that we're
actively mining.

0:12:37.495,0:12:42.976
Only once we've started making contributions
to the network will we be able to register successfully.

0:12:43.645,0:12:48.260
Once you've registered successfully, make
a note of the token you are issued with, as

0:12:48.260,0:12:50.899
this will be required in the future!

0:12:50.899,0:12:54.610
With your address and token, you can then
check the history of your wins, using the

0:12:54.610,0:12:56.820
link on the main page.

0:12:56.820,0:13:01.990
If you have any troubles with these steps
please head over to the xmrvsbeast subreddit

and search for similar issues before posting.

You may be wondering how to know when you
can successfully sign up to the raffle.

0:13:16.110,0:13:23.089
You can easily check the progress of your
miner remotely by visiting mini.p2pool.observer.

0:13:23.089,0:13:27.750
Here you can use your Monero address to search
and find your individual progress.

Once again, as we're new to mining we'll get
an error.

0:13:30.850,0:13:36.258
Only once we've begun finding shares will
we see information about the miner and its progress.

0:13:37.013,0:13:40.680
Once we see a valid share, we can then sign
up for the raffle.

0:13:40.680,0:13:45.129
To find out how often you may produce shares,
head back to the main page and select the

0:13:45.129,0:13:51.829
average share time calculator, punch in your
hashrate and you'll receive an estimate.

0:13:51.829,0:13:55.032
Let's take a look at another miners progress
to see an example.

0:13:56.210,0:14:02.172
Here you can see statistics from the miner
including average effort, blocks found and share positions.

0:14:03.161,0:14:05.550
Here the shares move from right to left with
time .

0:14:06.857,0:14:11.200
Below this you'll see information about each
payout and the shares which enabled those

0:14:11.200,0:14:12.575
payouts at the bottom.

0:14:19.642,0:14:21.199
Well, there you have it!

0:14:21.199,0:14:24.850
Hopefully you're now up and running and earning
those sweet rewards.

0:14:24.850,0:14:29.720
As a parting note, please remember this pool
is only possible because of the hard work

0:14:29.720,0:14:30.889
of contributors.
